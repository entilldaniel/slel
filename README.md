# SLEL

A tool to query the SL API for departures from either a preselected station or from a list of destinations.

This tool is only intended for metro stations so it will only query for that kind of transportation even though it shows 
other destinations (bus stops etc.). 


### Installation

Should be as simple as loading it in your init.el and the interactively (M-x) call sl/show-selected or sl/select-and-show.
The naming can and probably will change in the future. 



### TODO
- Make the preselected list customizable.
- Close/bury buffer with 'q'
